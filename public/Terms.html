        You agree that it is your sole responsibility to maintain the security of your Account and control over any usernames, passwords, or any other codes that you use to access our Services.

    </p>
    <h2>Payments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Credits.&nbsp;</strong>
            We use credits as the virtual currency for transactions on the Sites (“Credits”). Credits could be obtained by Users from (i) direct purchase made by Users; (ii) purchase at a discounted rate based on different subscription plans the user has purchased (as defined below). When users purchase credits, 
            the current balance of your credits and your purchase history will be displayed in your account, and the credits can be used for both ChatAvatar and Rodin services; (iii) gift upon registration; (iv) redeem code.
            <p>
                Please note that any credits purchased via subscription will expire at the end of the subscription period. We charge less for such Credits under Subscription Plans in exchange for longer commitment. In contrast, 
                the Credits purchased by Users will retain their validity until they are used. For Users who value flexibility the most, we recommend you purchase Credits directly.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Subscription.&nbsp;</strong>
            We offer different types of Subscription Plans (“<strong>Subscription Plans</strong>”) on the Sites for Users to choose, which cover both ChatAvatar and Rodin Services. 
            We set different price for each type of Subscription Plan (“<strong>Subscription Price</strong>”). You may use the Credits to sign up for the Subscription Plans or pay through the payment processing method on the Sites directly. 
            Once subscribed, we will grant you certain membership rights and interests as described under the relevant Subscription Plan.
            <p>
                Please note that upon payment, the Subscription Plan chosen by you cannot be canceled or downgraded within the corresponding subscription period. You may choose to upgrade your Subscription Plan to a higher level at any time during the subscription period. Upon upgrading, 
                the billing period will be reset and commence from the date of the upgrade. The price payable for the upgraded Subscription Plan will be the difference between (i) the total Subscription Price of the upgraded Subscription Plan for the new full billing period 
                and (ii) the per day Subscription Price of your current plan multiplied by the number of days remaining under the current Subscription Plan. Upon upgrading (where "upgrading" refers to an increase in credits), the number of credits will be adjusted to match the amount included in the upgraded subscription plan, with the difference between the updated plan and the previous plan added accordingly, 
                regardless of the credits used prior to the upgrade. If the upgraded plan is priced lower than the previous plan, the difference will be refunded in the next billing period. Please ensure that sufficient funds are available to complete the payment for the upgrade; otherwise, your membership may be suspended.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Making Payments.&nbsp;</strong>
            You are allowed to purchase Credits, assets, membership, or any other Content made available to you on the Sites or through the Services. 
            Deemos may make available to you various payment processing methods to facilitate the purchase of content through the Service. You may use different currency to make such payment but such currency will be converted to US Dollars upon payment to us. 
            You agree to abide by any relevant terms of service or other legal agreement, whether with us or with a third party, that governs your use of a given payment processing method. You agree that Deemos reserves the right to add or remove payment processing methods at its sole discretion and without notice to you. 
            If you are directed to Deemos's third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party's service and that third party's privacy policy. Please review such third party's terms and conditions and privacy policy before using such service. 
            <p>
                You represent and warrant that you have the authority and right to use the payment method selected by you and that such payment method has sufficient credit or funds available to complete your payment. If you believe someone has made unauthorized purchases without your permission, you should notify us of the charge immediately. 
                We reserve the right to close any Account with unauthorized charges.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Refund.&nbsp;</strong>
            UNLESS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE AGREEMENTS OR UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO, ALL PAYMENTS ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW. PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT AI SERVICES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. In the event that you are dissatisfied with the AI Services provided, 
            you are encouraged to contact the Company to discuss potential alternative solutions that can be mutually beneficial. The Company will offer its best effort to find a mutually agreeable solution, but this cannot be guaranteed.
            <p>
                For the avoidance of doubt, Credits are not redeemable, refundable, or exchangeable for real currency, actual monetary instruments, goods or other items of monetary value. 
                Credits have no equivalent value in fiat currency and do not act as a substitute for fiat currency. The purchase and use of Credits is governed solely by us in our sole discretion and application of these Agreements. Credits are non-transferable and can only be used in connection with the applicable Services. 
                You acknowledge and understand that by purchasing a Credit you are not acquiring any personal property right over it, or any equity or other ownership or profit-sharing interest in Deemos or any of our affiliates or any brand or other business venture.
            </p>
            <p>
                As discussed elsewhere in these Agreements, there may be situations where Content/Services may be removed from the Sites (due to violations of these Agreements or for other reasons). We want to remind you that all sales are final and there shall be no refunds except as required by law. 
                We will not allow changes to your purchase after you complete it. We will have no liability for any losses you may incur as a result, and will not be liable to refund any funds you spent in or for that Content.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Disputes and Late Payments.&nbsp;</strong>

Any late payment of the invoice that are not disputed by Users within the Invoice Dispute Period may be subject to a finance charge of 1.5% of the unpaid balance per month, 
            and we may suspend the Services immediately after providing written notice of late payment to you. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Prompts and Output</h2>
    <p>
        Our Services allow you to submit, post, upload, display or otherwise provide (“<strong>Provide</strong>”) to us text or images (“<strong>Prompts</strong>”) on or through the Sites or the Services to generate Content (“<strong>Output</strong>”) based on your Prompts.

If you wish to acquire further rights, please contact us directly at <strong> <a el="nofollow" style="color: #ddd;" href="mailto:hello@deemos.com">hello@deemos.com</a></strong>. 
            </p>

                You may set your Output generated by ChatAvatar as private, by which other Users will have no access to such Output. If you use Rodin to generate Output, we will not limit your use of such Output, subject to any restrictions set forth in these Agreements, the Applicable Laws and any third-party terms applicable to such Output or Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that we make no representations, warranties or undertakings of any kind as to the copyrightability of any Output or the availability of Intellectual Property Rights in which it may be applied for, registered or credited to any person.

    <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. YOU AND DEEMOS AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>MANDATORY ARBITRATION.&nbsp;</strong>
            SUBJECT TO SECTIONS 21.2 TO 21.6, ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR, CLAIM OR DIFFERENCE OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING THE EXISTENCE, VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION, PERFORMANCE, BREACH OR TERMINATION THEREOF, THE VALIDITY, 
            SCOPE AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND ANY DISPUTE REGARDING NON-CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO IT (EACH, A “<strong>DISPUTE</strong>”), SHALL BE REFERRED TO ARBITRATION UPON THE DEMAND OF EITHER PARTY TO THE DISPUTE WITH NOTICE (THE “<strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE</strong>”) TO THE OTHER PARTY (PARTIES).
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <strong>Informal dispute resolution.&nbsp;</strong>
            We would like to understand and try to address your concerns prior to formal legal action. Before either of us files a claim against the other, we both agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally. You agree to do so by sending us notice to <strong> <a el="nofollow" style="color: #ddd;" href="mailto:hello@deemos.com">hello@deemos.com</a></strong>. 
            We will do so by sending you notice to the email address associated with your account. If we are unable to resolve a Dispute within 60 days, either of us has the right to initiate arbitration. We also both agree to attend an individual settlement conference if either party requests one during this time. Any statute of limitations will be tolled during this informal resolution process.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <strong>Arbitration Procedure.&nbsp;</strong>
            The Dispute shall be settled and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the National Arbitration and Mediation (the “<strong>NAM</strong>”) in accordance with its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable (the “<strong>Rules</strong>”) in force when the Arbitration Notice is submitted in accordance with the Rules, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this Section 21. 
            The arbitration will be conducted by videoconference if possible, but if the arbitrator determines a hearing should be conducted in person, the location will be mutually agreed upon, in the county where you reside, or as determined by the arbitrator, unless the batch arbitration process applies. The arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California. 
            The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, except the state or federal courts of Los Angeles, California have the authority to determine any Dispute about enforceability, validity of the class action waiver, or requests for public injunctive relief, as set out below. Any settlement offer amounts will not be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after the arbitrator determines the final award, if any. The arbitrator has the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute.
            <p>
                If 25 or more claimants represented by the same or similar counsel file demands for arbitration raising substantially similar Disputes within 90 days of each other, then you and Deemos agree that NAM will administer them in batches of up to 50 claimants each (“<strong>Batch</strong>”), unless there are less than 50 claimants in total or after batching, which will comprise a single Batch. NAM will administer each Batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one arbitrator, one set of arbitration fees, 
                and one hearing held by videoconference or in a location decided by the arbitrator for each Batch. If any part of this section is found to be invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, it will be severed and arbitrated in individual proceedings.  
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Exception.&nbsp;</strong>
            This section does not require informal dispute resolution or arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <strong>Continue Performance.&nbsp;</strong>
            During the resolution of the Dispute, the Agreements shall continue to be performed except with respect to the part in dispute and under arbitration.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>WAIVER OF CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS.&nbsp;</strong>
            ALL DISPUTE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  
            IF A DECISION IS ISSUED STATING THAT THE APPLICABLE LAWS PRECLUDES ENFORCEMENT OF ANY OF THIS SECTION 21.6'S LIMITATIONS AS TO A GIVEN CLAIM FOR RELIEF, THEN THE CLAIM MUST BE SEVERED FROM THE ARBITRATION AND BROUGHT INTO THE COURTS OF HONG KONG.

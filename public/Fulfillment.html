    <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>
        All payments made on our platform are final and non-refundable, except as required by applicable law. This includes payments for AI services, which are expressly non-refundable. Credits purchased or earned within the platform are not redeemable, refundable, or exchangeable for real currency or any other items of monetary value.

    </p>

        Please note that upon payment, the Subscription Plan chosen by the subscriber cannot be canceled or downgraded within the corresponding subscription period. Subscribers may choose to upgrade their Subscription Plan to a higher level at any time during the subscription period. Upon upgrading, the billing period will be reset and commence from the date of the upgrade. The price payable for the upgraded Subscription Plan will be the difference between (i) the total Subscription Price of the upgraded Subscription Plan for the new full billing period, and (ii) the per day Subscription Price of the subscriberâ€™s current plan multiplied by the number of days remaining under the current Subscription Plan. Upon upgrading (where "upgrading" refers to an increase in credits), the number of credits will be adjusted to match the amount included in the upgraded subscription plan, with the difference between the updated plan and the previous plan added accordingly, regardless of the credits used prior to the upgrade. If the upgraded plan is priced lower than the previous plan, the difference will be refunded in the next billing period. Subscribers should ensure that sufficient funds are available to complete the payment for the upgrade; otherwise, their membership may be suspended.
    </p>

    <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <p>
        Once a Subscription Plan is purchased, it cannot be cancelled or downgraded during the active subscription period. Subscribers may choose to upgrade their Subscription Plan at any time during the subscription period. The cost to upgrade will be calculated based on the difference between the new plan's price for the remaining period and the per-day price of the current plan multiplied by the days left.
    </p>
    <p>
        If an upgrade is performed, any unused Credits under the current plan will be cancelled, and new Credits will be issued upon successful upgrade completion. Subscribers must ensure sufficient Credits or funds are available to complete any upgrades, as failure to do so may result in suspension of membership privileges.

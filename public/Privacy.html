    <h2>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies and similar technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to provide the Services and to
        collect data. In addition, third parties may also use Tracking Technologies when you use the Services; for
        example, if we engaged a third party to operate the Services, or because the Services contain content or
        advertisements delivered by third parties. These Tracking Technologies consist of the components below.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cookies are small text files that are unique to your device or browser. They can either be session-based (i.e.,
        lasting only while your browser is open and automatically deleted when you close your browser) or persistent
        (i.e., lasting until you delete them or they expire).
    </p>
    <p>We use Tracking Technologies for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sign-in/authentication. When you sign into your account to use the Services, we use Tracking Technologies to
            store your sign-in information. This allows the Services to remember your user preferences and give you a
            more tailored experience based on those preferences. It also allows you to use the Services without having
            to sign-in on each page or each time you return.
        </li>
        <li>Security. We use Tracking Technologies to help detect fraud and abuse of the Services, including attempts to
            access the Services without authorization.
        </li>
        <li>Analytics. We use Tracking Technologies to gather usage and performance data about the Services, including
            counting the number of unique visitors to a particular Service.
        </li>
        <li>Tailoring the Services. We use Tracking Technologies to collect information about how you use the Services
            so that we can tailor your experience based on what is most relevant to your interests.
        </li>
        <li>
            In some cases, we may work with third parties (for example, third party operators of the Services) to
            synchronize our unique, anonymous identifiers (such as those associated with Tracking Technologies) with the
            third party’s own identifiers. This enables us to better achieve each of the purposes described above.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You may disable cookies if you want. However, if you choose to disable cookies, certain parts of the Services
        may not work properly. For more information about cookies and how to manage them, please visit:

    </p>
    <h2>Security Of Data</h2>
    <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or
        method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect
        your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
    </p>
    <h2>Privacy Rights & Removal Of Data</h2>
    <p>You may at any time review or change the information in your account or terminate your account by emailing
        requests to
        <strong> <a el="nofollow" style="color: #ddd;" href="mailto:hello@deemos.com">hello@deemos.com</a></strong>.
        Upon a
        request to terminate your
        account, we will deactivate or delete your
        account and information from our active databases.
    </p>
    <p>In particular, you may at any time request personal data be removed and deleted.</p>
    <p>We will do our best to honor these requests. However, please note that some information may be retained to comply
        with legal requirements, including, but not limited to, the need to prevent fraud; stop abuse of the Services;
        resolve payment disputes; assist with national, local or international investigations; and enforce our Terms of
        Use.
    </p>
    <h2>Service Providers</h2>
    <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals ("Service Providers") to facilitate our Service, to provide
        the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is
        used. These third parties may have access to your data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are
        obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.
    </p>
    <h2>Links To Other Sites</h2>
    <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you
        will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every site
        you visit.
    </p>
    <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third
        party sites or services.
    </p>
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children").</p>
    <p>Our policy is to not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 14. We encourage parents and
        guardians to monitor their children’s online behavior, put parental control tools in place, and teach children
        not to provide their personal data through the Services without parental consent.
    </p>
    <p>If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 14 has provided personal data to us without parental
        consent, please contact us immediately. We will endeavor to delete that data from our systems.
    </p>
    <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Policy on this
        page. We advise you to review this page periodically for changes to this Policy. Your continued use of the
        Services after any changes to this Policy constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy.
